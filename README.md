# Developing Apps for Teams

This sample application demonstrates how to integrate a Web application into Teams. It supports the following features:

- [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) (MSAL) when the app runs outside of Teams
- [Single Single-On](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso) when the app runs inside of Teams
- Use of the [Teams JavaScript client SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest)
- Teams app [custom tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs)
- [Bots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots) that leverage [LUIS and QnA Maker Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services#language-apis)
- App to bot communication

**NOTE:** This application is a work in progress that will continue to be enhanced and updated over time. Consider forking this repository if you want to easily return to this version.

## Prerequisites

To build and run the solution in a development environment, you will need:

- [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) subscription that is associated with the same Azure AD tenant as the M365 tenant (see section 1.2 below for details)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1)
- [ngrok](https://www.ngrok.com) or equivalent tunneling solution for testing the Bot

## Setup

The following instructions will help you get the project running locally on your computer. If you want to deploy it to Azure, you will need to adjust the URL of where the web app is hosted to match the URL of your web app in Azure.

### 1. Set up the web application

First, we'll set up the Customer Orders App, which is a single-page application and associated web service that provides the application's tabs.
#### 1.1 Set up SSL and a host name

Start by creating a self-signed SSL certificate and custom host name that will resolve to your computer. In these instructions, we use the host name _devappsforteams.local_; if you choose something different, please substitute your name for that one in the steps that follow. Note that your host name must be a valid DNS name (FQDN).

**NOTE:** Although ngrok provides a way to run a local server using SSL and access it externally, we won't be using it here since 2 tunnels would be needed for this app (one for the app itself and one for the bot). As a result you would need a paid version of [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). While we won't be using ngrok here to run the app (due to the paid requirement), if you do have a paid version of ngrok you can skip this section and use the URL of your ngrok tunnels instead.

##### 1.1.1 Create certificate authority and a certificate

1. Open terminal
1. Create a certificate authority by executing:

    ```sh
    npx mkcert create-ca --organization "MyOrg" --validity 825
    ```

1. Create a certificate by executing:

    ```sh
    npx mkcert create-cert --ca-key "ca.key" --ca-cert "ca.crt" --validity 825 --domains "devappsforteams.local"
    ```

    As the domain name, you can specify the DNS host name (FQDN) you chose to use throughout the project. In the next step, you will configure your computer to resolve this hostname to your local machine.

1. Follow the steps in [this article](https://bob1german.com/2020/10/17/setting-up-ssl-for-tabs-in-the-teams-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code/) to add the generated certificate authority to your cert store.

##### 1.1.2 Configure a host name for the tab and SSO web service

1. In a code editor (start as administrator), open your `hosts` file based on your target operating system:

    **Windows:** `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

    **Mac:** `/etc/hosts`
    
    Append your FQDN as shown next: `127.0.0.1    devappsforteams.local`
    
    **IMPORTANT:** Make sure that you replace `devappsforteams.local` with the FQDN you chose in the previous steps.

1. Save your changes

##### 1.1.3 Configure certificate and host name with the web app

1. In the `CustomerOrdersApp` folder, create a new folder named `.cert`
1. Copy the generated `cert.crt` and `cert.key` files to a new folder `CustomerOrdersApp/.cert`
1. In the code editor, open the `CustomerOrdersApp/server.js` file and on this line, update the value of the `domain` const to match your FQDN if you chose something different.

~~~javascript
domain = 'devappsforteams.local';
~~~

#### 1.2 Deploy Azure AD configuration

1. Obtain your Microsoft 365 tenant ID. This indicates the Azure AD instance that is used by your Microsoft 365 tenant. To obtain the Microsoft 365 tenant ID, browse to [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), log in with your development M365 account, and then browse to the Azure Active Directory option on the left. The Tenant ID on the overview page contains the tenant ID you need to use in your `az login` command.

![Tenant ID must match](./docs/images/TenantIDMatch.png)

> NOTE: If the Azure subscription you plan to use is associated with a different tenant ID, you will need to change it so both the Azure services and M365 are using the same Azure AD instance. Note that this change is likely to break other solutions already deployed in the Azure subscription, so if there are other solutions already in use, you'll want to obtain another Azure subscription and associate it with your M365 tenant. For detailed instructions, follow [this blog article](https://laurakokkarinen.com/how-to-use-the-complimentary-azure-credits-in-a-microsoft-365-developer-tenant-step-by-step/) from MVP [Laura Kokkarinen](https://twitter.com/laurakokkarinen). 

1. In the code editor, open the `setup/setup.ps1` file
1. Change the value of the `$domain` variable to the FQDN you chose previously followed by `:8443`, eg. `devappsforteams.local:8443`
1. Start PowerShell
1. Change the working directory to `setup` (a folder located in this repository)
1. Login to Azure:

    ```powershell
    az login --tenant <REPLACE_WITH_TENANT_NAME_OR_ID> --allow-no-subscriptions
    ```

1. If this is the first time you've run a PowerShell script on this computer, run PowerShell as an administrator and enable script execution on your computer:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    ```

1. Execute the setup script:

    ```powershell
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

    **Tip:**
    If the setup script fails with an `Request_ResourceNotFound` error, execute the script again. Sometimes creating the Azure AD app takes longer than expected and when the script continues, the app isn't fully provisioned yet. Running the script again will update the previously created app with the missing values.

1. Take note of the `AppId`, `AppPassword` and `AppUri` output by the setup script. Make sure that you save these values somewhere secure before continuing.

#### 1.3 Configure the web app

1. In the code editor open the `CustomerOrdersApp/.env sample` file
1. Change the value of the `AppId` and `AppPassword` properties to match the values returned by the setup script in the previous step
1. Save the file as `CustomerOrdersApp/.env`
1. Open `CustomerOrdersApp/src/app/core/core.module.ts` and change the `clientId` value shown to your the `AppId` value that you saved in the previous section.

#### 1.4 Start the web app

1. Open terminal
1. Change the working directory to `CustomerOrdersApp`
1. Restore project dependencies by executing:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Build the web app by executing:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

1. Start the web app by executing:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

1. Verify that you can open the web app, by navigating in the browser to `https://devappsforteams.local:8443`, where the domain name is the FQDN you chose previously

### 2. Set up the Bot

*Bots* allow users to interact with your application through conversational text, interactive cards, and task modules. *Messaging extensions* allow users to interact with your application service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search or initiate actions, and can interact with users when they compose a message, use the command box, or use the context menu directly from a chat message.

#### 2.1. Configure Cognitive Services

Two Azure Cognitive Services, LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Services) and QnA Maker, are used to enable the bot to respond to natural language requests from users.

##### 2.1.1 Set up LUIS model (Language Understanding Intelligent Service)
